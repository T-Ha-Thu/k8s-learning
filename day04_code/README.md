Day 4: 𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗞𝘂𝗯𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘁𝗲𝘀? 𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗿 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗲𝘀  
Hello #LinkedInCommunity and #TheCloudOpsCommunity ,  
  
Today I want to share the Day 4 of #40DaysOfKubernetes journey with #Piyushsachdeva .  
Below are the lecture of Day 4 learning.  
  
  
I’ve been studying every day — from Day 01, Day 02, and Day 03 — and today I even ran a small project and completed all the lab exercises.  I’ve been putting in consistent effort and staying motivated each day.   
  
- Write the challenges of using standalone containers.  

Standalone containers are good for simple, single-app deployments, but they become difficult to manage, scale, and maintain in production environments.  
  
- Describe how Kubernetes solves those challenges  
  
Kubernetes turns containers into resilient, scalable, and manageable units. What was manual and error-prone with standalone containers becomes automated, monitored, and easier to maintain.  
  
- Use Kubernetes when you need scalability, reliability, and automation.  
  
Avoid Kubernetes when simplicity, speed, and minimal resources are more important.
